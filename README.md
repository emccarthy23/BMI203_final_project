## assignment

1. Implement a machine learning algorithm to classify RAP1 binding sites


## usage

To use the package, first run

```
conda install --yes --file requirements.txt
```

to install all the dependencies in `requirements.txt`. Then the package's
main function is a module to create a neural network. See the jupyter notebook
to see an example of calling this function.

## testing

Testing is as simple as running

```
python -m pytest
```

from the root directory of this project.
